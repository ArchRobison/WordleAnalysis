"""
    readResponses(filename)

Read responses from a file. Each line should be one of:
* a letter-coded response (b=black, y=yellow, g=green),
* a comment line beginning with #.
* a blank line

    hasResponse(answer, response)

True if for given answer, there exists a guess that yields the given response.
This is a low-level function that operates on an AnswerIndex.

Return answers that have at least one guess that yields the given response.
This is a low-level routine that operates on Vector{AnswerIndex}.
"""

    sift(answers, response)

Return answers that have at least one guess that yields the given response.

    return answerWords[sift(indicesOfWords(answers, answerWords), Response(response))]

    sift(answers, responses)

Return answers that are plausible for the given responses.

Return responses that are inconsistent with the answer.
